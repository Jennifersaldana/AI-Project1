"""
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) â€” NumPy Only
======================================
Requirements:
- Load MNIST directly from raw image files.
- Create your own training/testing partitions.
- Represent each image as a flattened 784-dimensional vector.
- Compute Euclidean distance.
- Classify by majority vote among k neighbors.
- Test with at least k = 1, 3, 5.
- No scikit-learn KNeighborsClassifier.
